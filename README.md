# Task-Rabbit
####Task-Rabbit clone <br>
To check what does this project looks like first we need to set up HTTP server. For now I use python to set up HTTP server. <br>
One simple example if your folder is placed on Desktop.

```
cd Desktop/Task-Rabbit
```
Now let's set up HTTP server.

```
python -m http.server 8000
```
After that you are ready to enter this 
```
localhost:8000
```

to your favorite browser and see what does Task-Rabbit looks like. <br>
Made just for fun and learning purposes.
